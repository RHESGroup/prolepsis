# PROLEPSIS

Prolepsis is the wrapper folder around the two instrumentator tools for CFI policy enforcing. `arm-cfi-tool` wraps code and benchmarks for the instrumentator working
on binaries compiled against ARM architecture. `risc-v-cfi-tool` wraps code and benchmarks for the instrumentator working on binaries compiled against RISC-V architecture.
You can find all the information about each of them in the `README.d` in their respective folders.
